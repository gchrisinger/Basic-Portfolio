    <p>I like goats who faint and I'm convinced that puppy paws smell like popcorn. I also enjoy dumplings, playing the uke and murders of crows. I love to draw and I am not very good with computers. Thankfully, I am currently taking a course to get better. What else to say? I like politics. I'm not very good at spelling or cooking but great at loading and unloading the dishwasher (probably beacuse it is a lot like Tetris). I am very good at Tetris. It annoys me when people misuse the word "literally." If I could be any animal, I would be an otter. I'm not good at driving. I think I would like to skydive and I have never been. I think that I would like Iceland and I have never been there (mostly to go hang out in hot springs with snow monkeys, how cool would that be!)
        My dreams are weird. No one likes hearing about other people's dreams but I like writing mine down. Since I'm tasked with writing about myself, might as well tell you about a dream I had. I was playing poker with a pelican on pancake point when a clam with a pearl pounced out of the puddle the pelican purched upon and spit the pear right into the pelican's eye. The End.
